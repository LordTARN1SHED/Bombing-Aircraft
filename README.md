## Game Rules
    ### 1.    Setup
    •    The game is played on two grids (typically 10x10), one for each player.  
    •    Players secretly place their “aircrafts” on their grids. Each aircraft occupies a set number of grid cells in specific shapes, such as “T” or “L” formations.  
    •    The aircraft formations may vary, but players must agree on the shapes and sizes before the game begins.  
    ### 2.    Gameplay
    •    Players take turns “bombing” each other’s grids by calling out specific grid coordinates (e.g., A5 or C7).  
    •    The opponent checks their grid and responds with “hit” if an aircraft’s cell is bombed or “miss” if the cell is empty.  
    •    If the center (cockpit) of an aircraft is hit, the entire aircraft is destroyed, and the opponent declares it.  
    ### 3.    Winning the Game
    •    The game continues until one player destroys all of the opponent’s aircraft.  
    •    The player who destroys all aircraft first wins the game.
